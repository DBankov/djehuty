// Section: Types

// Description: This struct stores an x and y and is used to specify a point.
struct Coord {

	// Description: The x coordinate.
	double x = 0;

	// Description: The y coordinate.
	double y = 0;

}

// Description: This struct stores an x any y, or a width and height, useful for some measurements.

// Description: This struct stores a description of a rectangle.

	// Description: The x point of the top-left of the rectangle.

	// Description: The y point of the bottom-right of the rectangle.
	double bottom = 0;

	// Description: The x point of the bottom-right of the rectangle.
	double right = 0;

	// Description: This function will test whether another rectangle intersects (overlaps) this one.
	// test: A rectangle to test.
	// Returns: Will return true when the rectangle given by test overlaps.

		return !(left > test.right || right < test.left || top > test.bottom || bottom < test.top);

// Description: This enum gives values for orientations.
enum Orientation {
	// Description: This indicates that something should go left to right.
	Horizontal,

	// Description: This indicates that something should go top to bottom.
	Vertical
}

// Window Styles

// Description: This enum gives all possible window styles.  Use the SetStyle() function within the BaseWindow class to set the style of the window to this value.
enum WindowStyle : int {
	// Description: Represents a non-sizable window.
	Fixed,

	// Description: Represents a common sizable window.
	Sizable,

	// Description: Represents a borderless window.
	Popup,

// Window States

// Description: This enum gives all possible window states.  Use the SetState() function within the BaseWindow class to set the state of the window to this value.
enum WindowState : int {
	// Description: This would be the normal view of the window.  Sometimes refered to as the restored view.
	Normal,
	// Description: This state will cause the window to be minimized.  Sometimes refered to as shrinking, or even rarely iconizing.
	Minimized,
	// Description: This state will cause the window to be maximized, and this would mean the window would get as big as it can within the constraints of the desktop environment.
	Maximized,
	// Description: This state will cause the window to take up the entire screen, essentially the width and height would be that of the current screen resolution on the current display.
	Fullscreen
}

// System Colors

// Description: This enum gives all possible system colors to query.
enum SystemColor : ubyte {
	// Description: This would be the normal window background style.  Give this to the constructor, and it will produce a normal looking window.
	Window = 0,

// Section: Types


// Mouse structure
//   from the Window class

// Description: This struct gives the state of the mouse input for a window.

	double x = 0;
	// Description: The y coordinate in coordination to the client area of the window of the mouse cursor.

	// Description: The number of clicks the user has done in a row.  1 is a single click.  2 is a double click, and so on.  You should use the mod operator to use this property properly.
